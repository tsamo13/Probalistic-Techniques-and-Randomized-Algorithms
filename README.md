# Probabilistic-Techniques-and-Randomized-Algorithms

This repository contains a comprehensive report on key concepts and techniques from the "Probabilistic Techniques and Randomized Algorithms" course, offered by the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department at the University of Patras.



## Overview

The project explores fundamental concepts in probabilistic techniques and randomized algorithms, presenting solutions to a variety of challenging problems. Each solution is designed to be clear, well-structured, and theoretically grounded, with step-by-step derivations and justifications.


## Contents
The report covers the following topics:

### Graph Theory:

- Analysis of random graphs (G<sub>n,p</sub>), including sample space points and their probabilities.

- Calculation of degree distribution, average degree, and average number of edges in random graphs.

- Exploration of monochromatic subgraphs in complete bipartite graphs (K<sub>m,n</sub>).

- Determination of threshold probabilities for the existence of specific graph structures, such as triangles in G<sub>n,p</sub>.

### Ramsey Theory:

- Investigation of conditions for the existence of monochromatic arithmetic progressions within colorings of numbers.

### Satisfiability Problems (SAT):

- Proofs related to the satisfiability of k-SAT formulas, often leveraging probabilistic methods like the Lovasz Local Lemma.

### Markov Chains and Random Walks:

- Construction of one-step transition matrices for discrete-time Markov chains.

- Derivation of stationary distributions.

- Calculation of expected first passage times and commute times in various graph structures.
